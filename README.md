## About Me

I’m a student passionate about software development and technology. I’m currently focused on building projects on my own initiative to learn and improve my skills.

## Projects

Here are some projects I have developed or that are in progress:

1. **Apollo (In development)**

   * **Description:** An editor for bottle rockets (built from PET bottles), aimed at the **Olimpíada Brasileira de Foguetes (OBAFOG)**.
   * **Languages:** C++, GLSL
   * **Repository:** Currently private due to the development stage.

2. **Erdos-Straus Solver (Application available and functional; in development)**

   * **Description:** A solver for the Erdős-Straus Conjecture that computes solutions quickly in real time.

   * **Languages:** C++, C

   * **Repository:** [Repository link](https://github.com/luizhverrisouza/Erdos-Straus-Solver)

   * **Equation:**

     `4/n = 1/x + 1/y + 1/z`  with `n, x, y, z` in `Z+` and `n > 1`.

   * **Summary:** The solver explores integer combinations for `y` and `z` in the range `[1, max_xyz]` and, for each valid pair `(y, z)`, computes `x` that satisfies the equation. It includes internal optimizations that discard impossible combinations, reducing search time.

3. **Mararuana Engine (In development)**

   * **Description:** A general-purpose engine intended for the development of software of any kind.
   * **Languages:** C++, GLSL
   * **Repository:** Currently private due to the development stage.

## Skills

* **Programming Languages:** C++, GDScript, GLSL, Lua (learning)
* **Web Development:** p5.js (learning)
* **Databases:** None at the moment
* **Tools & Technologies:** Git (learning)

## Contact

* **Email:** [luiz.verri.souza@gmail.com](mailto:luiz.verri.souza@gmail.com)
* **LinkedIn:** none
* **GitHub:** luizhverrisouza

## Education

* **Level:** Final year of Brazilian High School (3rd year)

Thanks for visiting my GitHub! I’m always open to feedback and collaborations, so feel free to get in touch. I’ll work on these projects whenever possible — since they’re independent and maintained only by me, updates may take a bit of time.
